# Brain_tumour_classification_brats_2018_dataset
This repository contains a model for classifcation of brain tumour into HGG,LGG on brats 2018 dataset . The dataset conatins 4 types of MRI scans of Brain namely t1, t2, t1ce, flair.
Preprocessing the dataset by fusing the images using DWT,PCA fusion increases accuracy of classification as compared to single neural network architecture . Here PCA fusion is used as a preprocessing technique
for fusion of t2 and t1ce images which increases accuracy by a substantial amount .
